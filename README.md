# Cypress UI Tests for AutomationExercise.com

This project includes automated end-to-end UI tests for [AutomationExercise.com](https://automationexercise.com), developed using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). Cypress is particularly interesting because, according to the official recommendations from its developers, it does not encourage the use of the Page Object Model (POM) â€” a design pattern commonly used in UI test automation to organize web page elements and actions into separate classes or objects. Instead, Cypress promotes implementing reusable test logic and actions through custom commands, enabling cleaner, more maintainable, and straightforward test code.


## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

The tests cover key user flows and interface checks, including:

- Opening the home page  
- Navigating to the Signup/Login page  
- Filling out user registration forms  
- Verifying elements and content on the page  

## Technologies Used

- **Cypress** â€“ JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework  
- **Node.js** and **npm** â€“ for dependency management
